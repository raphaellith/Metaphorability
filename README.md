# Metaphorability

Metaphorability is a simple game which tests your improvisational skills. It can be played by any number of players.

To generate a new prompt, click the "New prompt" button at the bottom of the page. A typical prompt looks like this:

_Love is like coffee..._

Players must then complete the metaphor by pointing out similarities between the two objects mentioned. For example:

_Love is like coffee - sweet but expensive._

There is no correct answer. Creative jokes - however hilarious, ridiculous or dark - are allowed and encouraged.

While a scoring system is not required, players can easily implement one themselves.


# Supported devices

Metaphorability runs on laptops and desktop computers. Phones and tablets are currently not supported.
